Who was the 'best' salesman?
    We would query the sold_cars table, something like:
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sold_cars WHERE sales_person_id = "5";

    And this would return the number of rows in the table that 
    sales person 5 appears in thus telling us how many cars they've sold
    you could do this for each sales person - I'm sure there is an SQL 
    command to find the most common (best sales person) but i don't know it!





    What make of car was the most 'successful'?
    What model was the most 'successful'?

        -> Explain how they would find this out (SQL query if possible, or just describe in words).
        -> Any thoughts on 'best' / 'successful'?
